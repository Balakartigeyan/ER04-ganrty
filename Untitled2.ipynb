        "The previous code failed because the `results` object returned by `model.train()` is a `Trainer` object, not `DetMetrics`, and therefore does not have a `path` attribute. I need to correct `results.path` to `model.trainer.save_dir` or simply infer the path based on the `project` and `name` parameters, as `results` object itself does not directly expose a 'path' attribute in the same way. The `Trainer` object, which is accessed via `model.trainer` after training, contains the `save_dir` attribute. Alternatively, the return value `results` from `model.train()` in recent `ultralytics` versions directly holds the `save_dir` as an attribute. However, the `results` returned from `model.train()` is actually `DetMetrics` object, which does not have `path` or `save_dir`. The actual save directory is `project` + `name`.\n",
